These files are not part of Liminix per se. They are "scratchpad"
configuration for devices I'm testing with or running on my local
network.

Over time, some of the code in this folder will be tidied up,
rewritten, rearchitected or simply moved into Liminix itself.
This is a folder of first drafts.

Q: Why are all the filenames misspelled?

A: The filenames correspond to actual hostnames in my network, and
the naming theme for telent.net is typographical errors.
