Making quite reasonable progress, though only running under emulation.
Since almost everything so far has been a recap of nixwrt, that's to
be expected.

The example config starts some services at boot, or at least attempts
to. Next we shoud

 - add some network config to run-qemu
 - implement udhcp and odhcp properly to write outputs
  and create resolv.conf and all that
 - write some kind of test so we can refactor the crap
 - not let the tests write random junk everywhere

We can store outputs in the s6 scan directory, it seems:

> There is, however, a guarantee that s6-supervise will never touch subdirectories named data or env. So if you need to store user information in the service directory with the guarantee that it will never be mistaken for a configuration file, no matter the version of s6, you should store that information in the data or env subdirectories of the service directory.

what network peers do we want to model for testing?

- wan: pppoe
- wan: ip over ethernet, w/ dhcp service provided
- wan: l2tp over (ip over ethernet, w/ dhcp service provided)
- lan: something with a dhcp client

https://accel-ppp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ could use this for testing
pppoe and l2tp?

To build a nixos vm with accel-ppp installed (not yet configured)

  nix-build '<nixpkgs/nixos>' -A vm -I nixos-config=./tests/ppp-server-configuration.nix -o ppp-server
  QEMU_OPTS="-display none -serial mon:stdio -nographic" ./ppp-server/bin/run-nixos-vm

To test it's configured I thought I'd run it against an OpenWrt qemu
install, so, fun with qemu networking ensues. This config in ../openwrt-qemu
is using two multicast socket networks -

nix-shell -p qemu --run "./run.sh ./openwrt-22.03.0-x86-64-generic-kernel.bin openwrt-22.03.0-x86-64-generic-ext4-rootfs.img "

so hopefully we can spin up other VMs connected either to its lan or
its wan: *however* we do first need to configure its wan to use pppoe

uci set network.wan=interface
uci set network.wan.device='eth1'
uci set network.wan.proto='pppoe'
uci set network.wan.username='db123@a.1'
uci set network.wan.password='NotReallyTheSecret'

(it's ext4 so this will probably stick)

TODO - bugs, missing bits, other infelicities as they occur to me:

DONE 1) shutdown doesn't work as its using the busybox one not s6.

2) perhaps we shouldn't have process-based services like dhcp, ppp
implement "address provider interface" - instead have a separate
service for interface address that depends on the service and uses its
output

* ppp is not like dhcp because dhcp finds addresses for an existing
  interface but ppp makes a new one

3) when I killed ppp it restarted, but I don't think it reran
defaultroute which is supposed to depend on it. (Might be important
e.g. if we'd been assigned a different IP address). Investigate
semantics of s6-rc service dependencies

DONE 4) make the pppoe test run unattended

5) write a test for udhcp

6) squashfs size is ~ 14MB for a configuration with not much in it,
look for obvious wastes of space

7) some of the pppoe config should be moved into a ppp service

8) some of configuration.nix (e.g. defining routes) should be moved into
tools

DONE 9) split tools up instead of having it all one file

10) is it OK to depend on squashfs pseudofiles if we might want to
switch to ubifs? will there always be a squashfs underneath? might
we want to change the pseudofiles in an overlay?

11) haven't done (overlayfs) overlays at all

12) overlay.nix needs splitting up

13) upgrade ppp to something with an ipv6-up-script option

14) add ipv6 support generally

15) "ip address add" seems to magically recognise v4 vs v6 but
is that specified or fluke?

16) tighten up the module specs. (DONE) services.foo should be a s6-rc
service, (DONE) kernel config should be checked in some way

DONE 17) rename nixwrt references in kernel builder

18) maybe stop suffixing all the service names with .service

19) syslogd - use busybox or s6?
