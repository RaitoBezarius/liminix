# Contributing

[ This is a placeholder, because it's early days and the volume of contributions thus far can be counted in an eggcup ]

* Contributions are very welcome

* Please open an issue (or otherwise establish some kind of dialogue)
before you send a PR I haven't asked for.  Just so I know it's
expected and you're not wasting time doing something I won't accept or
have already started on

* The Nix code in Liminix is MIT-licenced (same as Nixpkgs), but the
code it combines from other places (e.g. Linux, OpenWrt) may have a
variety of licences.  I have no intention of asking for copyright
assignment: just like when submitting to the Linux kernel you retain
the copyright on the code you contribute.

* Please govern yourself in Liminix project venues according to the guidance in the [geekfeminism "Community Anti-harassment Policy"](https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Community_anti-harassment/Policy).

* If you've read the preceding bullets and don't find anything to disagree with, open a PR
