A brief guide to backward-incompatible changes
that are likely to break configurations or workflows

2023-07-13

* a significant re-arrangement of modules and services, which will
probably break any configuration written before this time. For a
detailed explanation, see
https://www.liminix.org/doc/configuration.html#modules

2023-12-10

* configurations (usually) need no longer import modules from
modules/outputs because devices are expected to do this instead. This
change is because the outputs that make sense in any given context are
usually a property of the device being installed onto.

* rename outputs.flashimage to outputs.mtdimage (and also diskimage to
mbrimage). This change is made in the expectation that "fooimage" is
the name of an outputs that gloms together other filesystem-like
outputs with some kind of partition table - so we might in future have
gptimage or lvmimage or ubimage.

Liminix is now targeted to Nixpkgs 23.11 (not 23.05 as previously).
Upstream changes that have led to incompatible Liminix changes are:

* newer U-Boot version
* util-linux can now be built (previously depended on systemd)
