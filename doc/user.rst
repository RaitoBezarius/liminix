User Manual
###########

This manual is an early work in progress, not least because Liminix is
not yet ready for users who are not also developers.

Configuring for your use case
*****************************

You need to create a ``configuration.nix`` that describes your router
and the services that you want to run on it. Start by copying
``vanilla-configuration.nix`` and adjusting it.


Building and flashing
*********************

You need to set ``<liminix-config>`` to point to your
``configuration.nix``, the file for your hardware device definition as
argument ``device``, and to choose an appropriate output attribute
depending on what your device is and how you plan to install onto
it. For example:

.. code-block:: console

    nix-build -I liminix-config=./tests/smoke/configuration.nix --arg device "import ./devices/qemu" -A outputs.default

``outputs.default`` is intended to do something appropriate for the
device, whatever that is. For the qemu device, it creates a directory
containing a squashfs root image and a kernel.

Future versions of this manual will at this point refer to
device-specific instructions for installing Liminix using the router's
Web UI or other non-invasive method. As of Feb 2023, the only way to
flash a device is to take the cover off and connect wires to the
serial console pads - so, check in the Developer Manual.


Updating a running device

Feature forthcoming.
